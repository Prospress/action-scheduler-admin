The generated POT template file is not included in this repository. To create this file locally, follow instructions from [README.md](https://github.com/Prospress/action-scheduler-admin/blob/master/README.md) to install the project, then run the following command:

```
npm run i18n
```

After the build completes, you'll find a `action-scheduler-admin.pot` strings file in this directory.
